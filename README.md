## Overview

This MCP (Model Context Protocol) server leverages the [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/) API, one of many Farcaster [clients](/a16z/awesome-farcaster#clients) to provide a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with the Farcaster protocol through LLMs like Cursor and Claude . Farcaster is a popular decentralized social media protocol supported on Solana, Ethereum and other EVM compatible networks (e.g. Base, Optimism, Arbitrum e.t.c.).

## Features

- Publish a cast
- Get a cast's information
- Follow and unfollow other users
- Get users' followers and followed users
- Like and unlike a cast
- Recast a cast
- Get your and other users' profile information
- Get Warpcast API status
- Get recent casts and users
- Get channel information
- Get channel followers
- Get channel members
- Get channel blocked members
- And many other features.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (Python package installer and environment manager)
- A Farcaster account's 24-word mnemonic passphrase. Which means a Farcaster account is required.

### Option 1: Local Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kaiblade/farcaster-mcp.git
cd farcaster-mcp

# Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
uv venv
uv pip install -e .

export MNEMONIC="<your-farcaster-account-mnemonic-passphrase>"

# Run the server
uv run farcaster_mcp.py
```

### Option 2: Docker Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kaiblade/farcaster-mcp.git
cd farcaster-mcp

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t farcaster-mcp .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e MNEMOMIC="<your-farcaster-account-mnemonic-passphrase>" farcaster-mcp
```
## Environment Variables

- `MNEMONIC`: Required. A Farcaster account's 24-word mnemonic passphrase.

## Security Notes

- Never expose your Farcaster account's mnenomic passphrase in the source code
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

## Usage

Once the server is running, configure the [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/downloads) desktop to
connect to the server with:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "Farcaster-mcp": {
            "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/sse"
        }
    }
}
```

Since the MCP server is using the Server-Sent Events (SSE) [transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#built-in-transport-types) instead of the Standard Input/Output (stdio) transport, which Claude desktop only supports, the server won't work with it except through an [MCP proxy](https://github.com/sparfenyuk/mcp-proxy).

### Available Tools
The server exposes several endpoints that can be used to interact with the Farcaster protocol. Below are some of the tools that are exposed:

- `post_cast`: Publish a cast to the farcaster protocol.
- `follow_user`: Follow a user using their Farcaster ID (fid).
- `unfollow_user`: Unfollow a user using their fid.
- `recast`: Recast a cast.
- `like_cast`: Like a cast using its cast hash.
- `delete_cast`: Delete a cast you posted using its cast hash.
- `get_user`: Get a user's profile information using their fid.
- `get_me`: Get your profile information.
- `delete_cast_likes`: Unlike a cast using its fid.
- `get_healthcheck`: Get the status of the Warpcast API.
- `get_channel`: Get a channel's information using its channel ID.
- `get_channel_followers`: Get the list of a channel's followers.
- `get_user_followed_channels`: Using a user's fid, get their followed channels.
- `get_channel_members`: Get the list of channel members.
- `get_channel_banned_users`: Get the list of a channel's banned users.
- `get_channel_blocked_users`: Get the list of a channel's blocked users.
- `get_user`:  Using a user's fid, get their username.

### Example Queries

Here are some example questions you can ask Cursor or Claude once the server is connected:

```
- Post a cast of the current price of Solana in USD
- Get my profile info.
- How many followers does Linda Xie have?
- Get me the most recent Linda Xie's cast and like it.
- List the base channel members and their roles. Get their usernames as well.
- Who is the creator of the base channel?
- Is the API online?
```
